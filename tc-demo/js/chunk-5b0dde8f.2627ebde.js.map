(2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n     *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n     *\n     * So what to do?  The is the best:\n     *\n     *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n     *\n     * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n     * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n     *\n     *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n     *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n     *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n     *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n     *\n     * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n     * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n     * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n     * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n     * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n     * linear speed or acceleration.\n     *\n     * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n     *\n     *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n     *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n     *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n     *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n     *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n     *\n     *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n     *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n     *     pixels!\n     *\n     *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n     *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n     *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n     *\n     * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n     *\n     *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n     *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n     *\n     *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n     *\n     *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n     *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n     *     you know.\n     *\n     * Implementation info:\n     *\n     * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n     * average mouse:\n     *\n     *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n     *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n     *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *\n     * On the trackpad:\n     *\n     *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n     *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n     *\n     * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n     * also missing delta values.\n     *\n     * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n     *\n     * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n     *\n     * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n     * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n     * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n     * better normalize spin speed.
